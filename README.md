# tracerkinetic

This package implements compartmental models and linear approximations needed
to perform kinetic analysis on dynamic medical images (nuclear medicine). The
provided functions use the tissue time-activity curves, the input function and
the frame times as input, and return the kinetic parameters and the estimated
errors.
